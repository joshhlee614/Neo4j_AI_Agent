# Changelog

All notable changes to the Neo4j AI Agent & Knowledge Graph Builder project.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-06-23

### Added
- **LLM-Powered Knowledge Graph Builder**
  - PDF and text document ingestion with chunking
  - Automated entity and relationship extraction using OpenAI
  - Dynamic graph schema generation from extracted entities
  - Cypher statement generation for Neo4j population
  - Full pipeline orchestration from document to populated graph

- **AI Query Agent with Dynamic Schema Discovery**
  - Natural language to Cypher query translation
  - Real-time database schema discovery
  - Schema-aware query generation (uses only existing nodes/relationships)
  - Professional table output formatting
  - Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

- **Modular Architecture**
  - `builder/` module for knowledge graph construction
  - `agent/` module for query processing
  - `services/` module for core integrations (OpenAI, Neo4j)
  - `prompts/` directory for LLM prompt templates

- **CLI Interface**
  - Build mode: `python app.py --build document.pdf --ingest`
  - Query mode: `python app.py "natural language question"`
  - Interactive mode support

- **Development Features**
  - Mock modes for LLM and Neo4j services
  - Comprehensive configuration via .env file
  - Verbose logging and debugging options
  - Individual module testing capabilities

### Technical Implementation
- **14 Development Tasks Completed**
  - Document ingestion with PyPDF2
  - Entity extraction with structured JSON output
  - Schema inference from entity patterns
  - Cypher generation with proper formatting
  - Neo4j integration and population
  - Dynamic schema discovery for query generation

- **Data Pipeline**: PDF/Text → Chunks → Entities → Schema → Cypher → Neo4j → Queries
- **Supported Domains**: Financial data, academic papers, business documents, general text
- **Dependencies**: OpenAI API, Neo4j database, Python 3.8+

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with architecture diagrams
- Detailed installation and configuration instructions
- Usage examples and development guidelines
- Project structure documentation

## Known Issues
- Relationship discovery shows `UnlabeledNode` patterns (data quality issue)
- LLM occasionally generates non-existent relationships despite schema constraints
- Some generated Cypher statements may create unlabeled nodes

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced schema constraint enforcement
- Improved relationship endpoint labeling
- Query validation layer
- Support for additional document formats
- Fine-tuned prompts for better accuracy
